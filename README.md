# omero-common

A Gradle project

## Usage

Like any Java project, include the jar into your classpath.

## Build from source

The compilation, testing, launch, and delivery of the application are
automated by means of a Gradle (https://gradle.org/) build file.

In order to perform a build, you need JDK 11 and Gradle 6.x installed. Clone
this GitHub repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ome/omero-common

Go to the directory and enter:

    gradle build

This will compile, build, test and create a distribution bundle.

## Unit tests
 * Run `gradle test`
